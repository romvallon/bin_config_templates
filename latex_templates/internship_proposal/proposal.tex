\maketitle

Surfactants subtly impact the dynamics of multiphase flows. Despite being
difficult to measure and everywhere present, they induce critical changes even
at microscopic concentrations $O(10^{-7}\textnormal{mol}/\textnormal{m}^{-3})$.
Those molecules are absorbed on the fluid interface, which modifies the
interface properties and induces Marangoni forces. Up until today the effects of
surface-active molecules in industrial or natural flows have only been
quantified \textit{a posteriori} while the related research is recent and the
modelling of such effects is an open question.  Direct Numerical Simulations are
a useful tool to finely resolve the dynamics of a broad variety of flows and
would be helpful in the modelling surfactant dynamics. Before hand that becomes
possible, existing Navier-Stokes solvers need to be adapted to integrate
surfactant governing equations. 

Efforts are currently being led to implement the governing equations of
surfactant dynamics in the \href{www.basilisk.com}{Basilisk} Navier-Stokes
solver. The aim of this internship will be to contribute to the 3D
implementation as well as the testing of the code with case studies, like rising
bubbles. Solid knowledge of Fluid Mechanics and Numerical Analysis is expected
along with good programming skills (Matlab or Python) and good communication
skills in English, both oral and written. C++ and bash scripting skills are a
plus.Technical supervision will be provided by R. Vallon and scientific
supervision by S. Bagheri. Please provide a CV, a cover letter and your
2021-22 academic transcript.
